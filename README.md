## Feature detection & Result

####1. Total number of issues

This feature is quite straightforward. We decide to find the total number of issues of each team. And this feature can reflect briefly how team members communicate during the development period.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We counted total number of issues of each project. And here is the result.

```  
Number of issues:
  Project1: 67
  Project2: 80
  Project3: 93
```

####2. Number of issues without comments

We also want to know how many issues are actually no comments below. This feature goes deeper comparing to the first feature. And according to this feature, we can find out which issue actually makes the difference.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We also counted the number of issues without comments.

```  
Number of issues without comments:
  Project1: 5
  Project2: 41
  Project3: 6
```

####3. Number of issues each week

This issue is quite interesting.  We want to find out that which period is most likely to create issues, beginning or near the deadline. And we can analyse the results, which will help to optimize the development schedule.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We divided the total number of issues monthly, and get an array for each project.

```
  Project1: [24, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 5, 8]
```
![Project1](https://github.com/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/Project2_badsmell/blob/zhewei/project1_numberofissues_week.png)

```
![Project3](https://github.com/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/Project2_badsmell/blob/zhewei/project3_numberofissues_week.png)

####4. Total number of labels

We want to know the total number of labels each team created. Different number of labels reflect different kinds of situations and different levels of priorities each team will set.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We counted the total number of labels for each project.

```  
Total number of labels:
  Project1: 10
  Project2: 7
  Project3: 21
```

####5. Number of times each label was used

We can figure out which kind of label was used a lot of times, and which kind of label was seldom used. And the results will reflect whether the quantity and the setting of labels are reasonable or not.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We also counted the number of times each label was used.

####6. Mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label

This feature will show us mean and standard deviation of times spending in each label. And it will help us to analyse in depth. 

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We calculated mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label.

```  
Mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label:
  Project1:
          mean:       717715.441667
          standard:   735405.992596
  Project2:
          mean:       683042.074766
          standard:   1003264.24323
  Project3:
          mean:       428354.733945
          standard:   458374.563866
```

####7. "Unusually long" time a label

"Unusually long" time means 1.5 or 2 standard deviations time in a label. In normal distribution, 1.5 or 2 standard deviations means the data point is quite far away from the mean value. In this case, unusually long time a label may indicate team do little stuff during this time period.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We counted number of labels with unusually long time, which means 1.5 or 2 standard deviations time compatring to mean value.

```  
"Unusually long" time a label:
  Project1: 14
  Project2: 10
  Project3: 29
```

####8. Mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue

This feature will show us mean and standard deviation of number of labels assigned to each issue. And in this feature, we consider label and issue together, we want to find out the reasonable of the setting of labels. Also, we want to find out whether team members used to add corresponding labels to issues or not.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We calculated mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue.

```  
Mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue:
  Project1:
          Mean value          84452.1587302
          Standard deviation  173010.600703

```

####13. "Unusually small" number of issues handled only by one person

A issue handled only by one person means this issue is opened and closed by same person and no other guys write comments below this issue. We define number of issues handles only by one person less than 10% indicates this person is a "passenger". And it means responsibility distribution of this team may be uneven.

<b>Scripts are found here</b>

#####Result
We also calculated percentage of issues using milestones.

```  
Unusually small" number of issues handled only by one person:
 Project1: 
          user 1: 40.6

## Bad smells detector & Result 

###Issue Time Interval Detector [need Liang's data]
During the development cycle, team members will post some issues in order to communicate other members. However, the time interval between two issue creation may vary dramatically. This detector can analyse time interval to decide whether it is too long or too short. The result can reflect the process of each team. And we named it [issueTimeIntervalDetector.](https://github.com/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/Project2_badsmell/blob/zhewei/bad_smell_detector/issueTimeIntervalDetector.py) Below are pseudocode of algorithm we use to detect bad smells.
```
issueTimeInterval > mean + 2*std_dev:
    Badsmell: Too long time interval between this issue and the last.

issueTimeInterval < mean - 2*std_dev:
    Badsmell: Too little time interval between this issue and the last.

Otherwise:
    Issue interval time is normal this time
```

####Result
Because the result are too long, we eliminate some normal results and leave some bad smells.

##Issue Without Comment Detector
During the development cycle, team members will post some issues in order to communicate other members. However, the time interval between two issue creation may vary dramatically. This detector can analyse time interval to decide whether it is too long or too short. The result can reflect the process of each team. And we named it [issueTimeIntervalDetector.](https://github.com/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/Project2_badsmell/blob/zhewei/bad_smell_detector/issueTimeIntervalDetector.py)

####Result
##Bad smells results
##Early warning
**Interval of created time of two adjacent issues**

**Description**

We use the trend of created time of issues to find the early warning. We assume that the interval of created time of two adjacent issues is stable if the team is developing the project in a good plan. If the team creates many issues in a short time, it means the team is rushing. If the team doesn't create a issue in a long time, it means the team may not work on the project in schedule.
Assume the number of issues is a function of time: inum=f(t), it will increase linearly as time increases. The differential of f(t) is the interval of created time of two adjacent issues. And the interval should be fluctuating little between a constant. 

**Script**

We define the script as following:
```python
meaninterval=float(0)       #mean of interval
threshold=float(60*60*12)   #threshold for early warning extractor
thresholdnumbelow=4         #threshold indicating the team may be rushing
thresholdnumup=1            #threshold indicating the team may be following behind the schedule
belowinterval=0             #the number of intervals below mean-threshold
upinterval=0                #the number of intervals above mean+2*threshold

for i in range(0,len(interval)-1):
    meaninterval=(meaninterval*i+interval[i])/(i+1)
    if interval[i]<meaninterval-threshold:
        belowinterval=belowinterval+1
    else:
        if interval[i]>meaninterval+2*threshold:
            upinterval=upinterval+1
        else:
            upinterval=0
            belowinterval=0
    if belowinterval>thresholdnumbelow:
        print('the team may be pushing before issue',i)
        belowinterval=0
    if upinterval>thresholdnumup:
        print('the team may be falling behind the schedule before issue',i)
        upinterval=0
```
