##Feature detection & Results

**1. Total number of issues**

This feature is quite straightforward. We decide to find the total number of issues of each team. And this feature can reflect briefly how team members communicate during the development period.

#####Result
We counted total number of issues of each project. And here is the result.

```  
Number of issues:
  Project1: 69
  Project2: 93
  Project3: 93
```

**2. Number of issues without comments**

We also want to know how many issues are actually no comments below. This feature goes deeper comparing to the first feature. And according to this feature, we can find out which issue actually makes the difference.

#####Result
We also counted the number of issues without comments.

```  
Number of issues without comments:
  Project1: 5
  Project2: 41
  Project3: 6
```

**3. Number of issues each week**

This issue is quite interesting.  We want to find out that which period is most likely to create issues, beginning or near the deadline. And we can analyse the results, which will help to optimize the development schedule.

#####Result
We divided the total number of issues monthly, and get an array for each project.

```  
Number of issues every week:
  Project1: [24, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 5, 8]
  Project2: [10, 12, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 37, 1]
  Project3: [21, 8, 9, 2, 9, 10, 26, 5]
```

**4. Time interval between the creation of two issues**

"Time interval between two issues" is also related to last feature. And it is quite possible that the creation of issues is uneven. We can analyse and find out turn points during which the frequency of creating issues changes dramatically.

**5. Total number of labels**

We want to know the total number of labels each team created. Different number of labels reflect different kinds of situations and different levels of priorities each team will set.

#####Result
We counted the total number of labels for each project.

```  
Total number of labels:
  Project1: 10
  Project2: 7
  Project3: 21
```

**6. Number of times each label was used**

We can figure out which kind of label was used a lot of times, and which kind of label was seldom used. And the results will reflect whether the quantity and the setting of labels are reasonable or not.

#####Result
We also counted the number of times each label was used and sort the results incrementally.

```  
Number of times each label was used:
  Project1: 
          invalid 1
          duplicate 3

**7. Mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label**

This feature will show us mean and standard deviation of times spending in each label. And it will help us to analyse in depth. 

#####Result
We calculated mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label.

```  
Mean and standard deviation of time spent in each label:
  Project1:
          mean:       717715.441667
          standard:   735405.992596
  Project2:
          mean:       683042.074766
          standard:   1003264.24323
  Project3:
          mean:       428354.733945
          standard:   458374.563866
```

**8. "Unusually long" time a label**

"Unusually long" time means 1.5 or 2 standard deviations time in a label. In normal distribution, 1.5 or 2 standard deviations means the data point is quite far away from the mean value. In this case, unusually long time a label may indicate team do little stuff during this time period.

#####Result
We counted number of labels with unusually long time, which means 1.5 or 2 standard deviations time compatring to mean value.

```  
"Unusually long" time a label:
  Project1: 14
  Project2: 10
  Project3: 29
```

**9. Mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue**

This feature will show us mean and standard deviation of number of labels assigned to each issue. And in this feature, we consider label and issue together, we want to find out the reasonable of the setting of labels. Also, we want to find out whether team members used to add corresponding labels to issues or not.

#####Result
We calculated mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue.

```  
Mean and standard deviation number of labels assigned to each issue:
  Project1:
          Mean value          84452.1587302
          Standard deviation  173010.600703
  Project2:
          Mean value          90650.6617647
          Standard deviation  252940.849578
  Project3:
          Mean value          65775.3888889
          Standard deviation  159966.183254
```

**10. Number of times each milestone was used**

We are interesting in number of milestones. And each milestone usually represents one stage in development cycle. We can analyse which software development method each team used.

#####Result
We counted the number of times each milestone was used. And we sorted the result incrementally.

``` 
Number of times each milestone was used:
 Project1: 
          Num of millstones: 6
          Final release: 6
          V2: 8
          System test and Report: 8
          None: 11
          Beta Launch:  15
          V1: 19
          
  Project2:
          Small Scale Test and Comparison 4
          Num of millstones 5
          None 12
          Large Scale Test 13
          Final 17
          Project3: 21
          Basic Service and Test 23
          
  Project3:
          v0.1 4
          v0.2 5
          v0.3 6
          Num of millstones: 7
          v0.4 7
          v0.5 12
          v0.6 Cleanup 16
          None 46
```

**11. Percentage of issues using labels**

We want to see how many issues used labels.

#####Result
We calculated percentage of issues using labels.

```  
Percentage of issues using labels:
  Project1: 91.3% in 69 issues
  Project2: 73.1% in 93 issues
  Project3: 96.8% in 93 issues
```

**12. Percentage of issues using milestones**

We want to see how many issues used milestones.

#####Result
We calculated percentage of issues using milestones.

```  
Percentage of issues using milestones:
  Project1: 83.6% in 69 issues
  Project2: 82.6% in 93 issues
  Project3: 52.1% in 93 issues
```

**13. Percentage of issues using assignees**

We are interested in how many issues used assignees. And if the percentage of issues using assignees is high, which means responsibility distribution is clear.

#####Result
We also calculated percentage of issues using milestones.

```  
Percentage of issues using milestones:
  Project1: 19.1% in 69 issues
  Project2: 60.3% in 93 issues
  Project3: 72.2% in 93 issues
```

**14. "Unusually small" number of issues handled by one person(<10%)**

A issue handled by one person means this issue is opened and closed by same person and no other guys write comments below this issue. Number of issues handles by one person is less than 10% indicates this person is a "passenger". And it means responsibility distribution of this team may be uneven.

#####Result
We also calculated percentage of issues using milestones.

```  
Percentage of issues using milestones:
  Project1: 19.1% in 69 issues
  Project2: 60.3% in 93 issues
  Project3: 72.2% in 93 issues
```

**15. "Unusually large" number of commits handle by one person(>70%)**

Number of issues handles by one person is more than 70% indicates this person is a "great dictator". And it also means responsibility distribution of this team may be uneven.

Result

**16. Issue participating times of each user**

This feature calculates each user's frequency of attendency.

#####Result
We calculated issue participating times of each user.

```  
Percentage of issues using milestones:
  Project1: 
          user 1: 56
          user 2: 54
          user 3: 7
  Project2:
          user 1: 1
          user 2: 4
          user 3: 20
          user 4: 78
  Project3:
          user 1: 187
          user 2: 101
          user 3: 29
          user 4: 6
```
